      By default, all plugins that RabbitMQ ships with will be enabled.
      This default is great for QA & test environments, but not so good when benchmarking RabbitMQ.
      rabbitmq_management will always be enabled since it's used by all systems that poll RabbitMQ API for metrics.
      As a result, the leanest deployment will have `rabbitmq-server.only_enable_these_plugins: [rabbitmq_management]`.

  rabbitmq-server.mirroring_sync_batch_size:
    description: >
       Since RabbitMQ 3.6.0, masters perform synchronisation in batches.
       Earlier versions will synchronise 1 message at a time by default.
       By synchronising messages in batches, the synchronisation process can be sped up considerably.
       To choose the right value, you need to consider
         * average message size
         * network throughput between RabbitMQ nodes
         * net_ticktime value
       For example, if you set this value to 50000 (messages), and each message in the queue is 1KB, then each synchronisation message between nodes will be ~49MB.
       You need to make sure that your network between queue mirrors can accomodate this kind of traffic.
       If the network takes longer than net_ticktime to send one batch of messages, then nodes in the cluster could think they are in the presence of a network partition.
    default: 4096
  rabbitmq-server.mirroring_flow_control:
    description: >
       This is a controversial setting, understand its implications before changing the default
       Inter-node flow control sometimes has unexpected effects and it's not clear to some users whether it solves more problems than introduces or not.
       Observed behaviour
       * Channels sometimes enter permanent flow control state
       * Channels are credit-blocked on pids on remote nodes (as suggested by the 1st pid segment)
       * Eliminating mirroring via a policy makes the issue go away
       See https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/98

  rabbitmq-server.scheduler_bind_type:
    description: >
      Optimizes Erlang VM schedulers spread across CPUs
      The more spread over the hardware the schedulers are, the more resources are available to the runtime system http://erlang.org/doc/man/erl.html#+sbt
      For RabbitMQ =< 3.6.3, use rabbitmq-server.additional_erlang_args to set the scheduler bind type
      In RabbitMQ =< 3.6.3 stbt is not defined, erl defaults to 'unbound'
    default: db
  rabbitmq-server.additional_erl_args:
    description: >
      Add optional erl args - good for setting flags such as scheduler bind type in =< 3.6.3.
      Remember that init flags use '-' while emulator flags use '+'.
      For more info, see http://erlang.org/doc/man/erl.html
    default: ''
  rabbitmq-server.distribution_buffer_size:
    description: >
      Sets the distribution buffer busy limit (dist_buf_busy_limit) in kilobytes.
      Valid range is 1-2097151. Erlang default is 1024, RabbitMQ used to default to 32000 but has changed to 128000 since 3.6.11
      A larger buffer limit allows processes to buffer more outgoing messages over the distribution.
      When the buffer limit has been reached, sending processes will be suspended until the buffer size has shrunk.
      The buffer limit is per distribution channel.
      A higher limit gives lower latency and higher throughput at the expense of higher memory use.
    default: 128000
  rabbitmq-server.max_erlang_processes:
    description: >
      Sets the maximum number of Erlang processes.
      Recent versions of RabbitMQ default to 1048576, which should be sufficient for most scenarios.
      Nodes that service many clients (e.g. ~100k), or have many queues (e.g. ~50k), are known to require a higher value (e.g. 2000000).
      A process uses 338 words when spawned (2704 bytes on 64bit architectures), including a heap of 233 words.
      The actual maximum chosen may be much larger than the Number passed.
      Currently the runtime system often, but not always, chooses a value that is a power of 2.
      For more info, see http://erlang.org/doc/man/erl.html#max_processes & http://erlang.org/doc/efficiency_guide/advanced.html
    default: 1048576
  rabbitmq-server.max_erlang_atoms:
    description: >
      Sets the maximum number of Erlang atoms.
      Recent versions of RabbitMQ default to 5000000, which should be sufficient in almost all scenarios.
      It's unlikely that this value will need to be increased, it's exposed for consistency & transparency.
      For more info, see http://erlang.org/doc/man/erl.html#+t & http://erlang.org/doc/efficiency_guide/advanced.html
    default: 5000000
  rabbitmq-server.hipe_compile:
    description: >
      Set to true to precompile parts of RabbitMQ with HiPE, a just-in-time compiler for Erlang.
      This will increase server throughput at the cost of increased startup time.
      You might see 20-50% better performance at the cost of a few minutes delay at startup.
      These figures are highly workload- and hardware-dependent.
      HiPE has known issues in Erlang/OTP versions prior to 17.5.
      Using a recent Erlang/OTP version is highly recommended for HiPE.
    default: false
  rabbitmq-server.num_tcp_acceptors:
    description: >

    default: 10
  rabbitmq-server.delegate_count:
    description: >
      Number of delegate processes to use for intra-cluster communication.
      On a machine which has a very large number of cores and is also part of a cluster, you may wish to increase this value.
    default: 16
  rabbitmq-server.queue_index_embed_msgs_below:
    description: >
      Size in bytes of message below which messages will be embedded directly in the queue index.
      You are advised to read the persister tuning documentation before changing this https://www.rabbitmq.com/persistence-conf.html
    default: 4096
  rabbitmq-server.msg_store_credit_disc_bound:
    description: >
       The credits that a queue process is given by the message store.
       By default, a queue process is given 4000 message store credits, and then 800 for every 800 messages that it processes.
       A queue process persists AMQP messages by sending them 1 by 1 to the message store process.
       If the queue process sent 4000 AMQP messages and the message store process didn't manage to persist 800, the queue process will enter flow state.
       If the disks are fast and uncontended, as they should, the message store process will give the queue process 800 credits for every 800 messages that it processes.
       Messages which need to be paged out due to memory pressure will also use this credit.
       The Message Store is the last component in the credit flow chain.
       Learn more about credit flow https://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2015/10/06/new-credit-flow-settings-on-rabbitmq-3-5-5/
       This value only takes effect when messages are persisted to the message store.
       If messages are embedded on the queue index, then modifying this setting has no effect because credit_flow is NOT used when writing to the queue index.
    default: '{4000, 800}'
  rabbitmq-server.msg_store_io_batch_size:
    description: >
       Minimum number of messages with their queue position held in RAM required to trigger writing their queue position to disk.
       This value MUST be higher than the initial msg_store_credit_disc_bound value, otherwise paging performance may worsen.
    default: 4096
  rabbitmq-server.msg_store_file_size_limit:
    description: 'File size in bytes used for persisting messages'
    default: 16777216
  rabbitmq-server.credit_flow_default_credit:
    description: >

      Tunable value only for lazy queues when under memory pressure.
      This is the threshold at which the garbage collector and other memory reduction activities are triggered.
      A low value could reduce performance, and a high one can improve performance, but cause higher memory consumption.
    default: 1000
  rabbitmq-server.queue_explicit_gc_run_operation_threshold:
    description: >
      Tunable value only for normal queues when under memory pressure.
      This is the threshold at which the garbage collector and other memory reduction activities are triggered.

    default: 1000

  rabbitmq-management.rates_mode:
    description: >
      The management plugin by default shows message rates globally, and for each queue, channel, exchange, and vhost.
      These are known as the basic message rates.
      It can also show message rates for all the combinations of channel to exchange, exchange to queue, and queue to channel.
      These are known as detailed message rates.
      Detailed message rates are disabled by default as they can have a large memory footprint when there are a large number of combinations of channels, queues and exchanges.
      Alternatively, the message rates can be disabled altogether. This can help get the best possible performance out of a CPU-bound server.
